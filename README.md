## Installation Instructions

If SSH keys are installed, you can install the program by cloning it to your local machine by running git clone git@github.com:dolanpettit/Employee-Tracker.git. Once you have succesfully cloned to your local machine, be sure to install all required dependencies for application by running "npm i" in the command line. You will also want to connect your local machine to a mySQL database and input the schema.sql file. Without the database connected, this application will not be able to work properly.

## Usage Information

After the program has been installed, run it using node app. The application will first start off by asking what your role is as an employee. It will then ask for some boilerplate information such as name, ID number, and email. Depending on which role you've chosen, you will also be asked for some information specific to that role. For example, managers are prompted for their office number, engineers are prompted for the link to their github, and interns are prompted for the name of their school. After entering all employees necessary and selecting 'No" when prompted to add another employee, the application will generate the HTML file containing all of the teams information.
