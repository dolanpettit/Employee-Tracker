# Employee-Tracker

## Description

This is a CLI application that is focused on creating an HTML file with the inputted employee information provided by the user. This application is designed to prompt the user with specific questions based on their employee role. When all the prompts have been answered, an HTML file will be generated that can be displayed in the default browser displaying all the basic information of the employee's team. The file will be called "team.html".

## Installation Instructions

If SSH keys are installed, you can install the program by cloning it to your local machine by running git clone git@github.com:dolanpettit/Employee-Summary.git. Once you have succesfully cloned to your local machine, the "team.html" file should be deleted and the app.js file can be run using "node app". Be sure to install all required dependencies for application and testing purposes by running "npm i" in the command line.

## Usage Information

After the program has been installed, run it using node app. The application will first start off by asking what your role is as an employee. It will then ask for some boilerplate information such as name, ID number, and email. Depending on which role you've chosen, you will also be asked for some information specific to that role. For example, managers are prompted for their office number, engineers are prompted for the link to their github, and interns are prompted for the name of their school. After entering all employees necessary and selecting 'No" when prompted to add another employee, the application will generate the HTML file containing all of the teams information.
